## Predicting beneficieries of health assistance program in Indonesia villages

This project aims to predict the share of households in a village with national health insurance. This health insurance programâ€™s provides health coverage to low-income families in Indonesia. This analysis is done in village-level using village census provided by Statistics Indonesia. We use and compare several supervised learning techniques that will predict better our target variable. For some techniques, we use tuning to estimate parameters through bootstrapping. The goal is to find a model that minimizes root mean-squared error (rmse) in the testing data. Based on our analysis, the random forest model appears to be the most accurate in predicting the percentage of households in a village which receive free health insurance under the national health assistance program. Despite this, the model does not actually predict the outcome variable very well due to the high rmse. Future research should try using other models and embed new variables that may help to better predict the test data. Moreover, using supervised learning models to predict social science outcomes may lead to issues of external validity (both temporal and spatial) therefore, caution must be taken in interpreting the model predictions.
